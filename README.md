# timezone-bot
This is the start of a Discord Bot for Timezones.

# Prequisites:
- SQLite (former PostgreSQL) Database and Access
- Database driver
- Node.js
- Sequelize
- Discord.js
- Project Files

# How to use:
1. Copy the Project.
2. Enter your "config.json" values into the empty ones. (Note that the Database fields are only used for PostgreSQL! The Database Path for SQLite must be sqlite.db)
3. You're good to go! Just run "node index.js".

# Notes:
Some functions were delayed / removed to improve development speed of the core elements.
